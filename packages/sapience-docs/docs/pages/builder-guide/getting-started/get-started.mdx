If you already have some programming experience, [skip ahead](/builder-guide/guides/forecasting-agent).

This guide walks you through setting up an AI-powered code editor and creating recommended accounts. You can then customize existing code or build your own project from scratch.

## Cursor Setup

[Cursor](https://cursor.com) is a modern, AI-powered IDE with a free plan available. Also consider using [Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), and [v0](https://v0.app/).

### Add Docs

Allow your assistant to read these docs too.

1. Press `Cmd+K` (or open the palette) and type `@Docs`, or go to Settings → Features → Docs
2. Choose "Add doc"
3. Enter `https://docs.sapience.xyz/` as the URL
4. Name it "Sapience" and save to index
5. Use in prompts: `@Docs Sapience`

### Add Tools

Attaching the MCP server gives your editor tools that allow it to interact with Sapience's API directly. Learn more about the MCP server at [/builder-guide/api/mcp](/builder-guide/api/mcp).

1. Open Cursor → Settings → Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP → Add new MCP server
2. Paste the following configuration and save:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sapience": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://api.sapience.xyz/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Note this requires Node.js on your PATH so `npx` is available. (Ask an AI to help if you don't know what this means.)
- After saving, restart Cursor if tools do not appear.

## Ethereum Account Setup

You'll need an Ethereum wallet to interact with Sapience markets.

### Private Key Generation

You can use a wallet app or generate one locally for development.

- **MetaMask**: [Download browser extension](https://metamask.io/download/)
- **Rainbow**: [Download mobile app](https://rainbow.me/)
- **Coinbase Wallet**: [Download](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)

To generate a random private key from your terminal:

```bash
# Using OpenSSL (32 bytes -> 64 hex chars)
openssl rand -hex 32

# Or with Node.js
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

To derive the wallet address from a private key:

```bash
# Using Foundry (cast)
cast wallet address --private-key 0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY

# Or with Node.js + ethers v5 (ethers must be installed)
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY node -e "const { Wallet } = require('ethers'); console.log(new Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY).address)"
```

For development and testing:
1. Create a new wallet
2. Save your seed phrase or private key securely
3. Do not reuse this wallet for production

:::::warning
Never share your private keys or seed phrase. Use separate wallets for development and production.
:::::

### Wallet Funding

You'll need ETH on **[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/)** to pay gas fees for submitting forecasts. You can use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or other centralized exchanges to buy ETH and withdraw to the `Arbitrum One` network.

For trading on Sapience markets, you'll also need **USDe** on **Ethereal** for both gas and trading collateral. Visit [ethereal.trade](https://ethereal.trade) to bridge assets to Ethereal.

## Git Setup

If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one at [github.com](https://github.com/signup). Then, [download GitHub for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).

GitHub is essential for:
- Version control of your code
- Collaborating with others
- Deploying your applications

## OpenRouter Setup

OpenRouter provides access to multiple AI models for your applications.

1. Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to your API keys
4. Create a new API key for your project
5. Store the key securely in your environment variables

You can use OpenRouter to integrate AI capabilities into your Sapience-powered applications.

## Railway Setup

Railway makes it easy to deploy apps and agents with one-click deployment.

**Quick Start**: Deploy a forecasting agent instantly using the [Deploy a Forecasting Agent](/builder-guide/guides/forecasting-agent) guide.

For manual setup:
- Visit [railway.com](https://railway.com/) and create an account
- Create a new project and connect your GitHub repo
- Set environment variables in the project settings (see [Forecasting Agent environment variables](/builder-guide/guides/forecasting-agent#environment-variables) for reference)
- Deploy your services and verify healthchecks
