# Oracles & Settlement

Sapience markets resolve via oracle-attested outcomes using a pluggable settlement architecture.

## UMA Overview

UMA (Universal Market Access) is our primary oracle solution that provides dispute-based verification for market outcomes.

**How UMA Works:**
- **Assertion Phase**: Anyone can submit a market outcome claim with a bond
- **Challenge Period**: During the liveness window (typically hours to days), anyone can dispute the claim by posting a counter-bond
- **Resolution**: If no dispute occurs, the assertion is accepted. If disputed, UMA's voting mechanism resolves the truth
- **Finality**: Markets settle automatically once the challenge period expires without valid disputes

UMA's optimistic approach means most assertions resolve quickly without disputes, while the economic incentives ensure accurate outcomes through potential challenges.

## Order Book Markets Settlement Interface

Order Book Markets (CLOB-like) use the UMA Settlement Module for continuous trading with concentrated liquidity:

```solidity
interface IUMASettlementModule {
    event SettlementSubmitted(
        uint256 marketId, 
        address asserter, 
        uint160 settlementSqrtPriceX96, 
        uint256 submissionTime
    );
    event SettlementDisputed(uint256 marketId, uint256 disputeTime);
    event MarketSettled(uint256 marketId, bytes32 assertionId, uint160 settlementSqrtPriceX96);

    /**
     * @notice Submit a settlement price for a market
     * @param params Settlement parameters including market ID, asserter, and price
     * @return assertionId The UMA assertion ID for tracking
     */
    function submitSettlementPrice(SettlementPriceParams memory params) external returns (bytes32);

    /**
     * @notice Callback when UMA resolves an assertion
     * @param assertionId The assertion ID that was resolved
     * @param assertedTruthfully Whether the assertion was determined to be truthful
     */
    function assertionResolvedCallback(bytes32 assertionId, bool assertedTruthfully) external;

    /**
     * @notice Callback when UMA assertion is disputed
     * @param assertionId The assertion ID that was disputed
     */
    function assertionDisputedCallback(bytes32 assertionId) external;
}

struct SettlementPriceParams {
    uint256 marketId;
    address asserter;  // Address that posted the bond
    uint160 settlementSqrtPriceX96;  // Settlement price in sqrt format
}
```

## Auction Markets Settlement Interface

Auction Markets (Auction/Intent) use the Prediction Market Resolver interface (verifier) that markets connect to:

```solidity
interface IPredictionMarketResolver {
    enum Error {
        NO_ERROR,
        INVALID_MARKET,
        MARKET_NOT_OPENED,
        MARKET_NOT_SETTLED
    }

    /**
     * @notice Validate predicted markets before minting positions
     * @param encodedPredictedOutcomes Encoded outcomes to validate
     * @return isValid Whether outcomes are valid
     * @return error Error code if invalid
     */
    function validatePredictionMarkets(
        bytes calldata encodedPredictedOutcomes
    ) external view returns (bool isValid, Error error);

    /**
     * @notice Resolve a prediction and determine the winner
     * @param encodedPredictedOutcomes Encoded outcomes to resolve
     * @return isResolved Whether resolution is possible
     * @return error Error code if resolution cannot proceed
     * @return parlaySuccess True if maker wins, false if taker wins
     */
    function getPredictionResolution(
        bytes calldata encodedPredictedOutcomes
    ) external view returns (bool isResolved, Error error, bool parlaySuccess);
}
```
