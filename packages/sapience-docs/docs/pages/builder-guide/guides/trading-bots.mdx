# Prediction Market Trading Bots

This guide builds on the [Forecasting Agent](/builder-guide/guides/forecasting-agent) guide. Here, we'll add automated spot trading on individual markets using $1 wagers.

## Enable Spot Trading

To enable automatic spot trades on individual markets based on your forecasts:

```bash
# Enable spot trading feature
ENABLE_SPOT_TRADING=true

# Configure trade parameters (optional)
WAGER_AMOUNT=1000000000000000000        # $1 in USDe (18 decimals)
MIN_TRADING_CONFIDENCE=0.6              # Only trade with >60% confidence
MAX_TRADING_SLIPPAGE=5                  # Maximum 5% slippage
```

**Key Differences from Parlays:**
- Trades on **individual markets** rather than multi-leg combinations
- **No minimum market requirement** - can trade with just 1 confident prediction
- Uses the **Quoter API** to size positions for exact dollar amounts

## Custom Trading Implementation

If you want to build your own trading logic beyond the built-in spot trading:

### Dollar Wager Pattern

The bot uses a **Quoter API + Contract Call** pattern for exact dollar amounts:

1. **Query the Quoter API** to get position size for your target wager amount
2. **Call the contract** with the calculated position size and slippage protection

- [Quoter API usage →](https://github.com/sapiencexyz/sapience/blob/main/starters/elizaos/src/utils/contracts.ts)

### Integration Points

To wire custom trading into your agent:
- **Add to action registry** in `src/index.ts` 
- **Call from forecast loop** with confidence thresholds
- **Use existing blockchain utilities** from the starter for wallet management

## Advanced: Custom Limit Orders

For more sophisticated trading strategies, you can implement limit orders that wait for specific price targets:

**Example approach:**
- Monitor current market prices via polling or WebSocket
- Execute trades only when price reaches your target level  
- Use the same Quoter API + Contract Call pattern as spot trading
