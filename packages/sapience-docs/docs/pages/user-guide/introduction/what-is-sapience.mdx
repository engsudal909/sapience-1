# What is Sapience?

[Sapience](https://www.sapience.xyz) is an open source platform for prediction markets, where people place wagers on future events. Markets are powered by a simple, immutable [smart contract](https://github.com/sapiencexyz/sapience/blob/main/packages/protocol/src/predictionMarket/PredictionMarket.sol) which rewards wagered collateral to a winner according to a decentralized oracle network. Users broadcast a prediction and an amount they'd like to wager. This triggers an auction where others compete to provide the best odds.

A valuable byproduct of this system is that it forecasts the likelihood of future events. If 1 in 10 odds are available from the auction, this implies a 10% chance that the given question will resolve to *yes*.

This system is ideal for most prediction markets, as it supports custom parlays and niche forecasting questions that are valuable to predict. Markets with longer time horizons and more continuous trading activity are deployed as CLOB-like spot markets. These are implemented with a protocol that integrates with [Uniswap](https://www.uniswap.org), the most popular onchain decentralized exchange.

We believe recent developments in artificial intelligence have unlocked a new design space: *forecasting agents*. Prediction markets can incentivize their development and help society anticipate—and prepare for—the future. Our [developer tools](https://www.sapience.xyz/bots) are designed for hobbyists with no programming experience as well as professional trading desks.
