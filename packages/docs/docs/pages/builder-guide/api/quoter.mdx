# Quoter API

The Quoter API determines the largest position size that can be opened with a given amount of collateral while respecting target price constraints. It performs a bounded binary search against on-chain quoting to find a feasible, direction-aware size.

## Endpoint

- Production: `https://api.sapience.xyz/quoter` (confirm base URL)
- Local (monorepo): `http://localhost:3001/quoter`

### GET `/:chainId/:marketAddress/:marketId`

Returns the maximum feasible position size for the specified market and target price, within the provided collateral budget.

#### Path parameters
- `chainId`: Number. Chain ID where the market group is deployed.
- `marketAddress`: String. Market group contract address (`0x...`).
- `marketId`: Number. Market ID within the group.

#### Query parameters
- `expectedPrice` (required): Decimal string. Target reference price after the trade.
- `collateralAvailable` (required): Wei string. Collateral budget available for the position.
- `maxIterations` (optional): Integer 1–10. Bounded binary search iterations (default: 10; max: 10).
- `priceLimit` (optional): Decimal string. Price guardrail; defaults to current reference price.
  - For LONG: fill price must be `> priceLimit` and `<= expectedPrice`.
  - For SHORT: fill price must be `< priceLimit` and `>= expectedPrice`.

#### Response
```typescript
type QuoteResponse = {
  direction: 'LONG' | 'SHORT';
  maxSize: string;            // signed wei string: LONG > 0, SHORT < 0
  currentPrice: string;       // decimal string
  expectedPrice: string;      // decimal string
  collateralAvailable: string // wei string
}
```

Notes:
- `direction` is inferred from `expectedPrice` vs current reference price.
- `maxSize` is signed: positive for LONG, negative for SHORT. Its absolute value is the largest feasible size given constraints.
- All numeric values are strings to preserve precision.

## Examples

### Basic
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/quoter/1/0x1234000000000000000000000000000000005678/1?expectedPrice=1000&collateralAvailable=1000000000000000000"
```

Example response
```json
{
  "direction": "LONG",
  "maxSize": "500000000000000000",
  "currentPrice": "950",
  "expectedPrice": "1000",
  "collateralAvailable": "1000000000000000000"
}
```

### With price limit and custom iterations
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/quoter/1/0x1234000000000000000000000000000000005678/1?expectedPrice=1000&collateralAvailable=1000000000000000000&priceLimit=980&maxIterations=5"
```

## Errors

The API returns structured errors with appropriate HTTP status codes:

- 400 Bad Request
  - `Invalid query parameters` (validation details included)
  - `Expected price must be greater than 0`
  - `Expected price must be different from current price`
  - `Could not find a valid position size that satisfies the price constraints`
  - `Insufficient liquidity. Try a smaller size.`
- 404 Not Found
  - `Market not found`
  - `Current price not found`
- 500 Internal Server Error

## Implementation details

- The service reads the current reference price from `getReferencePrice(marketId)`.
- It runs a binary search (up to `maxIterations`, capped at 10) between zero and a theoretical cap derived from `collateralAvailable / currentPrice`.
- Feasibility at each step is checked by simulating `quoteCreateTraderPosition(marketId, signedSize)` on the market group contract.
- If the requested budget exceeds the feasible capacity at the price constraints, the service returns `400` with "Insufficient liquidity. Try a smaller size."
