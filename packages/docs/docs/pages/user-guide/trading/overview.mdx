# Getting Started

Trading on Sapience happens on [Ethereal](https://ethereal.trade), an appchain, using [Ethena](https://ethena.fi)'s reward‑bearing synthetic dollar USDe as collateral.

The [Sapience app](https://sapience.xyz) walks you through connecting your wallet and getting USDe when you click *Log in*.

## How It Works

Head to [sapience.xyz/markets](https://sapience.xyz/markets) to start trading.

1. **Build a prediction** — Select one or more picks across available markets. Combine multiple picks into a parlay for higher potential payouts.
2. **Choose your wager** — Enter the amount of USDe you'd like to use.
3. **Watch the auction** — Your prediction triggers a real-time auction where market makers compete to offer you the highest payout possible. Accept when you're happy with the odds.

Once you accept, your position is live. If your prediction is correct when the market resolves, you collect the payout.
