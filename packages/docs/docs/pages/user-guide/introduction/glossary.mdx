# Glossary

- **Question** - Something that can be resolved to *Yes* or *No* after a specific time.

- **Question Groups** - Contains one or many questions. Only one question in a question group can resolve to *Yes*. Questions can exist without being in a group.

- **Categories** - Displayed as "Focus Areas" in the Sapience app (e.g., Crypto, Weather, Geopolitics).

- **Forecast** - A question with a probability (0-100%) and an optional comment [submitted onchain](https://attest.org).

- **Pick** - A question paired with a predicted resolution (*Yes* or *No*).

- **Prediction** - Consists of a wager amount and one or many picks.

- **Wager** - Collateral staked on a prediction.

- **USDe** - [Ethena](https://ethena.fi)'s reward-bearing synthetic dollar, used as collateral in prediction markets.

- **Auction** - The system in which prediction market participants bid on taking the opposite side of a prediction.

- **Requester/Responder** - Requesters create auctions and responders bid in them. The requester stakes their wager amount on all of their picks being correct with a signed payload from a responder who predicts at least one pick will be incorrect.

- **Maker/Taker** - The maker is the first to write down a price. In auctions, the maker is the responder. For onchain limit orders, the maker is the person making the limit order.

- **Anti-Parlay** - A position generated for a responder, predicting that at least one of the requester's predictions will be incorrect.

- **Resolution** - The prediction market contract determining whether the answer to a question is *Yes* or *No*. Synonymous with "Settlement".

- **Verification** - Used in relation to signed payloads (i.e. signature verification), not market resolution.
